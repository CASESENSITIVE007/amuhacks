        The <b>Computer Science Society</b> (CSS) is the dynamic and official club of
        the <b>Department of Computer Science at Aligarh Muslim University</b> (AMU).
        With Prof. Arman Rasool Faridi as the esteemed President and Mr. Aftab
        Ansari as the dedicated Coordinator for this year&apos;s  session, CSS
        continues to thrive as a hub of innovation and excellence. Founded in
        December 2018 as the Area of Dominant Coders (ADC), CSS has rapidly
        evolved into a vibrant platform for knowledge sharing, technical growth,
        and practical learning within the department. Our mission is to empower
        students with cutting-edge skills, fostering their readiness for the
        fast-evolving tech industry. CSS actively collaborates with the Training
        and Placement Office (TPO) of both the department and the university to
        provide students with invaluable industry insights, skill enhancement
        programs, and career-building opportunities. One of our hallmark
        initiatives, <b>AMUHACKS</b>, organized in collaboration with <b>GDSC AMU</b>, has
        gained significant recognition as a premier platform for innovation,
        creativity, and teamwork. This event attracts brilliant minds from
        across the country, creating a competitive yet collaborative environment
        where participants push the boundaries of technology. Recognized by the
        university in March 2021, CSS remains steadfast in its mission to
        nurture creativity, foster collaboration, and equip students with
        industry-relevant skills.
